Data and codes for our paper **"Personalized Large-scale Functional Networks in Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Children: Linking Functional Network Topography with Socioeconomic Status"**.

Here, we delineated 17 *personalized functional networks* for Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (**ABCD**) children using 20 min high-quality fMRI data and have publicly shared this resource. 

We also provided an exemplary usage of this resource in predicting unseen individualsâ€™ socioeconomic status (**SES**) with *personalized functional network topography*, and discovered that the association between functional topography and SES was hierarchically patterned on the cortex along the sensorimotor-association cortical axis.  

## `data`
- This folder contains the subject information (`subjectkey`, `age` and `gender`) used in this study.

## `scripts`
- The [step02_singleParcel_NMF](step02_singleParcel_NMF) folder contains scripts used to generate personalized functional network topography for ABCD children and scripts used to get results of *Figure 1* and *Figure 2*.
