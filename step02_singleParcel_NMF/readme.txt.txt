this folder contains scripts to generate personalized functional networks by NMF, which includes three main steps:
1. initialization(group decomposition, step02_ParcellationInitialize)
2. robust initialization selection (step03_SelRobustInit)
3. decomposition (collaborative individual decomposition, step04_IndividualParcel)
other scripts used for analysis and figure plot:
figure 1 (step08_Visualize_Workbench_GroupAtlas) 
figure 2 (step09_Visualize_Workbench_AtlasVariability, step11_Fig2E_variability_withSArank)
