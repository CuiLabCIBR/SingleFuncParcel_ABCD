this folder contains scripts used for assocation analysis between inter-individual variability and SA gradient.
the procedure is the same for contribution weight in SES prediction.
step01_merge_variability_withSArank, merge variability and SA rank in one file.
step02_SpinTest, we did spin test for whole brain inter-individual variability.
step03_sort_variability_withSArank_Sig, sort the significance with spin test results.
