this folder contains scripts used to generate association results with SA gradient.
1. for inter-individual variability, we performed spin test for individual variability (Fig 2E).
2. for contribution weight (abs value) of SES prediction, we perfromed spin test for SA gradient (Fig 3G).
3. for sum of weight (raw value) of SES prediction (Fig 3E) and single network prediction (Fig3I), we performed spin test as in Fig 3G, 
and computed the averaged SA rank for each network.
4. spin tes for SA gradient in fsaverge5 is in /Fig3I_singleNetworkPerformance/fsaverage5_SpinTest
5. for Fig3E and Fig3I folder, we only gave the scripts for sorting significance, complete flowchart can be seen in Fig2E.
